                <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>India boasts of three prominent defense services, namely the Indian Army, Indian Air Force, and Indian Navy, all of which hold a high reputation for their unwavering dedication to the nation's protection. These forces have demonstrated their valour and honour time and again through their contribution towards safeguarding the country's sovereignty.</p>
                <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>In recent years, there has been a growing interest among the youth in serving in the defence services, owing to the charm and prestige of the various posts available in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is responsible for conducting exams to fill these coveted positions, and the final selection process is conducted by the Services Selection Board (SSB), an organization established by the Ministry of Defence, India.</p>
                <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>Aspiring candidates must meet specific eligibility criteria to join the Indian Army, such as completing at least 12th grade for the National Defence Academy (NDA) and holding a graduate degree for other defence academies. Meanwhile, those seeking to join the Indian Navy or Air Force must have a science background, although aspirants from any stream are eligible to apply for the administrative and logistic branches of these services. The UPSC conducts entrance exams, and the SSB interviews the candidates to select suitable candidates for these forces.</p>
                <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>The SSB interview is primarily a psychological assessment of the candidate's personality to evaluate their potential as future officers in the Indian Military. The selection process is designed to identify individuals with Officer-Like Qualities (OLQs), ensuring that only the most capable and deserving candidates are chosen to serve the nation in these highly prestigious defence services.</p>
                <ul style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
                    <li>Upon being selected, candidates who have completed their 12th grade are enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program at the National Defence Academy (NDA) and a Bachelor of Technology program at the Naval Academy.</li>
                    <li>In addition, there are several engineering-based positions within the armed forces that do not require aspirants to attempt the UPSC entrance exam, but they must pass the interviews conducted by the SSB.</li>
                    <li>Aspiring candidates seeking to fill vacant positions in the Air Force must first pass the Air Force aptitude test, which evaluates their suitability for the role.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Another critical member of the SSB is the Group Testing Officer (GTO), with each board consisting of four GTOS.</li>
                    <li>The Psychologist is another crucial member of the SSB, with each board having four psychologists who assess candidates' mental and emotional fitness for military service.</li>
                </ol>
                <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>Together, these members work collaboratively to assess the overall suitability of candidates for military service, taking into account a variety of factors such as leadership qualities, physical fitness, communication skills, and psychological well-being.</p>
                <h2 className="text text-success mt-3">Schedule at SSBs</h2>

                <h4 className="text text-success mt-3">Opening Address and Form Filling</h4>
                <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>Upon arrival at the selection center, candidates will receive an introductory talk from the duty officer, who will explain the administrative details and code of conduct to be followed during their time at the center. Additionally, candidates will be required to complete documentation and have their age and educational qualifications verified. Each candidate will also be assigned a unique chest number for further testing.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>It is important to note that candidates are not in competition with one another. Rather, each candidate will be assessed against a common standard of suitability, and it is possible for everyone in the group to be recommended or not recommended for further selection.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>Over the course of five days, candidates will undergo a series of tests designed to assess various aspects of their personality, rather than just their physical fitness. The exact schedule of tests may vary depending on the number of candidates being evaluated, and it is possible for the GTO tests to be conducted in a single day if necessary.</p>
                <h4 className="text text-success mt-3">General Instructions</h4>
                <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>The selection process consists of two stages, each lasting several days, excluding the day of arrival.

                <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>On the day following their arrival, candidates will be administered Stage 1 of the selection procedure. Candidates who do not meet the minimum requirements in Stage 1 will be sent home on the same day. Those who are recommended for Stage 2 only will be asked to stay for further testing.</p>
                <h4 className="text text-success mt-3">Documents</h4>
                <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>When arriving at the selection center, candidates must bring all original educational certificates and marksheets from class 10th up until their most recent education degree, including both provisional and graduate entry certificates. Additionally, candidates should bring two photocopies of all marksheets, duly attested.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>To serve as proof of identity, candidates may bring a photo identity card issued by their school or college, a driving license or passport, a voter identity card, an Aadhar card, or their UPSC admit card.</p>
                <h4 className="text text-success mt-3">Baggage</h4>

                <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}>It is necessary to bring two pairs of track suits or trousers/slacks along with appropriate tops or salwar kameez for outdoor tasks. These garments should be loose enough to allow for unrestricted movement but not excessively loose to hamper mobility.

                <h4 className="text text-success mt-3">For Sikh Candidates Only</h4>
