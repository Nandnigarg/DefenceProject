The AFPI offers a comprehensive two-year curriculum designed to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and training required to achieve their goal of becoming an officer in the Indian Defence Services.</p>
                <br />
                <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>The institute provides training in personality development and leadership skills, as well as a structured and integrated curriculum in the non-medical stream.
