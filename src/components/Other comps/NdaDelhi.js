                <ol style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
                    <li><span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Discipline:</span> NDA emphasizes discipline and dedication. Coaching institutes instill discipline by providing a structured study schedule, homework assignments, and regular tests. This helps students develop a disciplined approach towards their studies, time management, and overall preparation.</li>
                    <li><span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Comprehensive Coverage of Subjects:</span> The NDA exam covers subjects like mathematics and general knowledge, which require a deep understanding and extensive knowledge. Coaching institutes provide specialized study materials, experienced faculty, and resources that cover all the topics in a comprehensive manner. This ensures that students receive in-depth information and guidance to excel in these challenging subjects.</li>
                    <li><span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Time Management:</span>Time management is crucial in competitive exams like NDA, especially with the presence of negative marking. Coaching institutes teach effective time management techniques, helping students solve problems efficiently, allocate time to different sections, and attempt all the questions within the given time frame.

                    <li><span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Mistake Identification and Correction:</span>Self-study may lead to mistakes that go unnoticed due to the lack of guidance and mentorship. In coaching institutes, professionals can identify the mistakes made by students, provide guidance, and help them rectify those mistakes.

                    <li><span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Confidence Building:</span>The NDA exam requires not only mental but also physical preparedness.
