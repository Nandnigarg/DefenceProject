                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>To prepare for the NDA written exam, it is important to make the most of your school hours and understand everything that is taught in class. This will not only help you in your school board exams but also in the NDA written exam. Solving problems left by your teacher in class and going through examples in NCERT textbooks are also valuable for your preparation.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>Once you have finished these tasks, it is time to focus exclusively on NDA preparation. You can refer to recommended study material provided by your classroom teaching faculty to understand theory and practice problems.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>In addition to written exam preparation, it is also important to focus on interview and SSB preparation. Communication skills, group discussion, physical fitness, and GTO tasks are crucial for success in these aspects. Regular participation in debates, group discussions, and GTO tasks will help you prepare for the SSB and improve your chances of success.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>Remember, a disciplined approach to studying and regular practice is key to achieving excellence in the NDA written exam and SSB preparation.</p>
