                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", textAlign: "justify" }}>For students in class 11, NDA written exam preparation requires a more dedicated approach towards the syllabus. While still studying as per their CBSE board school curriculum, they need to put more effort into NDA preparation. This is where DCG Defence Institute comes in as the best NDA coaching in India after 10th class.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", textAlign: "justify" }}>Many students make the mistake of taking class 11 lightly, but it is a critical year for NDA preparation. Every chapter must be studied, and the concepts understood, as class 12 will utilize most of the topics from class 11, and the student will be appearing for the NDA exam while pursuing their 12th class. Every attempt to appear in the NDA exam is valuable due to the age limit being a crucial factor in defence entry. DCG provides an NDA foundation course after 10th class to help students develop the necessary skills and knowledge.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", textAlign: "justify" }}>For interview and SSB preparation, students must focus on communication skills, group discussion, physical fitness, and GTO tasks. Regular participation in debates, group discussions, and GTO tasks can help prepare for the SSB interview.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", textAlign: "justify" }}>It is important to note that students in class 11 cannot give the NDA exam. The educational qualification to appear for the NDA exam is to have passed class 12 from any recognized board. Candidates who are appearing in class 12 the same year are also eligible to appear for the NDA exam. If a student is in class 11, they are not yet eligible to appear for the NDA exam.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", textAlign: "justify" }}>To ensure success in the NDA exam, DCG Defence Institute provides comprehensive coaching that focuses on the specific needs of each student.
