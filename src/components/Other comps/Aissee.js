The concept of Sainik Schools was introduced in India in 1961 by the Ministry of Defence to provide quality education coupled with military training to aspiring students. These schools follow a unique curriculum that combines academic instruction with physical fitness, character development, and discipline.</p>
                <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>The primary goal of Sainik Schools is to nurture young minds and develop their overall personality, emphasizing the qualities of leadership, patriotism, and service to the nation. The schools aim to create a pool of talented individuals who can potentially join the prestigious National Defence Academy (NDA), the Indian Naval Academy, or other officer-training institutions in the armed forces.</p>
                <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>Attending a Sainik School offers several advantages.
