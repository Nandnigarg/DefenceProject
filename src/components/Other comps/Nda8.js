                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", textAlign: "justify" }}>If you are a class 8th passed out student and aspire to join NDA, it is essential to lay the foundation for your future preparation. However, at this stage, you don't need to put too much focus on NDA written exam preparation. Instead, concentrate on your school syllabus and aim to understand the concepts rather than just rote learning for marks.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", textAlign: "justify" }}>To develop competitive skills, you can participate in different Olympiads and exams like NTSE. These exams will help you build a strong foundation for future NDA preparation. Additionally, you can consider enrolling in a foundation course for NDA preparation offered by DCG Defence Academy. This course will help you develop an understanding of NDA's basics and help you prepare for CBSE board school exams simultaneously.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", textAlign: "justify" }}>For INTERVIEW and SSB preparation, you should start working on your communication skills and public speaking. It would be best if you also practiced group discussions, physical fitness, and GTO tasks.</p>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", textAlign: "justify" }}>Remember, it's never too early to start preparing for NDA. If you start from a young age, you will have an advantage over others and can create a strong foundation for your future success.</p>
